# SSL and code-signing certificate generation using a CA

# Note:
# - You will be prompted for passwords multiple times.
# - The -config openssl.cnf arguments is just for convenience to avoid
#   entering all the DN (distinguished names) everytime, it can be omitted
#   from all commands.

mkdir -p out

# Certificate authority private key:
openssl genrsa -des3 -out out/ca.key $ROOT_CA_BITS

# Certificate authority certificate:
# You will be prompted for a common name and email
openssl req -new -x509 -key out/ca.key -out out/ca.crt -config openssl.cnf -days $ROOT_CA_DAYS



# Subordinate (intermediate) CA for signing
# -----------------------------------------

# Create the key
openssl genrsa -out out/ia.key $INTERMEDIATE_CA_BITS

# Certificate request for subordinate CA
# You will be prompted for a common name (shown as Publisher name in the
# webstart dialog) and email
openssl req -new -key out/ia.key -out out/ia.csr -config openssl.cnf

# Sign certificate request:
openssl x509 -req -in out/ia.csr -CA out/ca.crt -CAkey out/ca.key -CAcreateserial -out out/ia.crt -days $INTERMEDIATE_CA_DAYS



# Apache SSL certificate
# ----------------------

# Create the key
openssl genrsa -out out/server-private.key $SSL_SERVER_BITS

# Certificate request for SSL certificate
# You will be prompted for a common name (server Domain name) and email
openssl req -new -key out/server-private.key -out out/server.csr -config openssl.cnf

# Sign certificate request:
