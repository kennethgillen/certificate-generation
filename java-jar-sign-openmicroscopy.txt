# Signing jars for webstart in openmicroscopy
# ===========================================
# First create certificates and keystore by following the guide in
# java-jar-sign.txt

# Building openmicroscopy
./build.py
# Sign jars, passing properties to the keystore
./build.py release-webstart -Djarsign.keystore=/path/to/store.jks -Djarsign.alias=testcodesign -Djarsign.storepass=XXXXXX -Djarsign.validity=366

# Note jarsigner won't take into account certificates that have been added
# via the Java Control Panel, so the following will show the jar as signed but
# not verified
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs openmicroscopy/dist/lib/insight/omero.insight.jar
